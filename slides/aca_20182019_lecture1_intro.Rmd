Advanced Crime Analysis

Computational Crime Science

Data Science for Crime Science

### What is this?


## Why not just "[fancy adjective] Crime Analysis"?

byte KB MB GB TB ZB ...

Per second ... per day



## Crime Science in the 21st century

New research questions!

New ways to solve problems!

Also: uncomfortable!!



## Aaah: so we're talking Big Data!

<img data-src="./img/aca_l1_1.gif">

## Problems with "Big Data"

- what is "big"?
- data = data?
- complexity of data?
- sexiness of small data

## Game-changers in Crime Science

1. existence of data
2. availability of data
3. availability of computing resources
4. obsession with prediction

## Current situation

Data Science Wild West

- Anything goes
- A lot of great things
- A lot of sh**

You'll learn to tell hype from promise!


## Becoming a real problem-solver

Principle 1: There's no magic in Data Science

Principle 2: Golden data never comes in a spreadsheet

Principle 3: Data treasures are hidden in front of you

## **Principle 1:**

### There's no magic in Data Science

<img data-src="./img/psm2_l1_5.gif">


## **Principle 1:** 

### There's no magic in Data Science

All names of current FBI most wanted terrorists?

Let's start here: [https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorism](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorism)

## Using data science techniques...

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(rvest)
target_page = read_html('https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorism')
target_page %>%
  html_nodes('p.name') %>%
  html_text()
```

## The magic? A few lines of code

```{r}
library(rvest)
target_page = read_html('https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/terrorism')
target_page %>%
  html_nodes('p.name') %>%
  html_text()
```


## **Principle 2:**

### Golden data never come in a spreadsheet

## **Principle 3:**

### Data treasures are hidden in front of you

## Yeah, really cool.

But: I don't need this "programming" for this!

## "Programming" is only the vehicle.

**Matter of volume**
